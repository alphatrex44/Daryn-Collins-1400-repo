# CSIS 1400 Repository README #

Congratulations on setting up your new repository for this course!

### What is a code repository used for? ###

A code repository is a storage service used to hold and version an application project.  It holds all of the files and code progress used in your applications.  It also keeps track of code changes, who's making them and when.

### What belongs in this repository? ###

All code projects that you create and manage for this class.  This includes code examples and programming assignments.  This will be the place you turn in all of your programming assignments for this class.  If you correctly map your PyCharm workspace to this repository location locally on your machine and keep it there, this expectation is easily met.

### What does NOT belong in this repository? ###

* Any files not related to CSIS 1400
* Files or folders that you supposedly deleted from your PyCharm workspace.  Remember that if you remove data from your PyCharm projects, they need to be removed from your local repository folder as well.
* Be sure to use the default .gitignore file from Github.

### How do I commit my updates to this repository? ###

Open up a terminal that's pointed to your local repository folder and execute these git commands:

* git add .
* git commit -am "[assignment_name]: [your commit message]"
* git push origin master

After you've done this successfully with no errors, come back to this repository in Github and ensure your changes have been correctly pushed to this repository.  If you don't see your changes here, you won't receive credit for completing your work.

### How do I receive help if I'm stuck on a programming assignment? ###
You are encouraged in this class to study with a partner in this class, but do NOT copy and paste code from others.  It's easy to identify duplicate code solutions.  Also, you can reach out to your course instructor to schedule a remote session, and it'll be scheduled as soon as possible.
